 * 
 * You will also need to specify
 * the redirect url under allowed settings as the return url that LWA
 * will call back to with the authorization code.  The authresponse endpoint
 * is setup in app.js, and should not be changed.  
 * 
 * lwaRedirectHost and lwaApiHost are setup for login with Amazon, and you should
 * not need to modify those elements.
